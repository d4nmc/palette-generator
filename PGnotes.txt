Project Outline

You are expected to create your job using a Pipeline script (a.k.a. a `Jenkinsfile`) which will allow your trainer to start up a job on their own Jenkins server with minimal configuration. The job should do the following:


1. Be triggered by a webhook.

~ Webhook working- activates on PUSH to gitHub from terminal

2. Clone down the contents of the repository.

AZURE CONNECT

3. Run unit tests.

~ Unit tests running succesfully through plugins

4. Run the application.

~ Job runs, deploy and test scripts edited

5. Configure Jenkins to notify developers when a job has been completed. This could be via email, a Teams message, a Slack message, etc.

~ Teams notification working

6. Publish the unit test and coverage reports using plugins.

~ Graphs and full performance break down available through jenkins, CAN THESE BE PUBLISHED TO A PERFORMANCE html page? different host maybe on a seperate machine?

7. Create two jobs that are triggered separately for the `main` and `development` branches:



8. Pushes to `development` should trigger tests to be run and the application to start in a 'staging' environment.



9. Pushes to `main` should trigger the application to start on a 'production' environment.



10. One or both of these 'environments' should be running on a separate VM. Think about how you could get Jenkins to control another machine remotely.
        


11. Use the `HOSTNAME` environment variable to display on the webpage whether the application is running on the 'staging' or 'production' environment.
